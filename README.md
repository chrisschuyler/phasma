# Introduction 
This is basically a hello world app, just showing a star wars character. In this case, Captain Phasma. It is a project meant to be a proof of concept using Jenkins and GitHub as source code repository and CI/CD build tool.

# Getting Started
This is a basic nodejs application using the express module's scaffolding to instantiate a web server and show a very simple page.

# Build and Test
Builds with NPM install. Build should be gated on tests passing. Tests are triggered from the npm test command, which executes jasmine-node-test.
